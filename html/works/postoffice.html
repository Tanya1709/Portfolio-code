                    <p>India Post is one of the most well connected services in the country with 1,55,000 post offices across India. There is at least one
Post Office in each Zone of the city. India Post not only targets mail services but also offers banking and insurance.

                    <h4 id="Problem">Problem</h4>
                    <p><span class="highlight highlight-THD">India Post uses traditional means of mail service and functioning which is different from other mail services which can make the
working of it slower or less efficient than the other services. </span>Another significant problem that India Post has to deal with is lack of
awareness in citizens regarding services India Post offers, or also lack of proper information regarding what information to put in
to process certain functions of the India post. </p>




<h4 id="Solution">Solution</h4>
                    <p> 
QR-Enabled Postal assistance that would help in automation of Pincode to avoid errors and also 
help in discovering India Post services and navigate to the place they are looking for.
<br>
The concept is to set up QR codes in the postal office to:
 
<ul >
 <li>Act as a way-finding system to help in navigation </li>
 <li>To avoid input of wrong information </li>
 <li>To be of service for creating awareness regarding the services offered with qr technology for faster registration for services </li>
 <li>Its would be a self-service system to calculate postage and pay seamlessly </li>
 <li>AI powered chatbot to help customers </li>

                  <p> <strong>Contextual Enquiry</strong>: Contextual inquiry is a semi-structured interview method to obtain information about the context of use, where
users are first asked a set of standard questions and then observed and questioned while they work in their own environments. The
Contextual enquiry consists of 5 models: 
<ul>
<li>Flow model </li>
<li>Sequence model </li>
<li>Cultural model </li>
<li>Physical model </li>
<li>Artifacts model </li>
</ul>

                  <br><br>
<p><strong> Questionnaire </strong>: A questionnaire is a research instrument consisting of a series of questions for the purpose of gathering
information from respondents. Questionnaires can be thought of as a kind of written interview. They can be carried out face to
face, by telephone, computer or post. </p>



<p> <strong>HTA</strong>: Hierarchical task analysis (HTA) is a widely used type of Task analysis where a high-level task is decomposed into a hierarchy
of subtasks. </p>

experience, goals and tasks, pain points, and environmental conditions. </p>
