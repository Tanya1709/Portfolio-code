                    <h4>Introduction</h4>
                    <p>The digital revolution has done much to reshape how students read, write, and access information. Once-handwritten essays are now word-processed. Encyclopedias have yielded to online searches. One-size-fits-all teaching is tilting toward personalized learning. And a growing number of assignments ask students to read on digital screens rather than in print. 
                        An ebook reader is a dedicated device that lets you read electronic books- With an 
ebook reader, you can carry thousands of books at a time and access a library 
of millions more on a device that is smaller than a paperback, lasts for weeks on a 
single charge, and gives you a better reading experience than a tablet, phone or laptop.
</span>
                    </p>

                    <h4 id="Problem">Problem</h4>
                    <p>The biggest challenge to reading attentively on digital platforms is that we largely use digital devices for quick action: Look up an address, send a Facebook status update, grab the news headlines (but not the meat of the article), multitask between online shopping and writing an essay.<span class="highlight highlight-THD"> When we want to read something academically substantive digitally we use laptop or tablet, or mobile phone but when it comes to more pleasure based reading, users prefer e-readers.</span>
                      <h4 id="Result">Result</h4>
                        <p>The goal of the project is to <span class="highlight highlight-THD">provide users with a holistic environment where they can enjoy readings at stretch for whether it is with the intention of reading novels or with the intention of academic growth </span> without being overwhelmed with all the things they can do.  </p>






            
                        <h4 id="Method">Methods Used</h4>
                
                  <p> To be able to design a eReading device from scratch, I analyzed the requirements and 
                    designed the final design on the basis of elements of interface design which includes
                    5 planes-
                    
<li> Strategy plane </li>
<li>Scope plane </li>
<li>Structure plane </li>
<li>Skeleton plane </li>
<li>Surface plane</li>
</ul>

                  <br><br>
<p>  The Strategy Plane is the most abstract level and is where the design process starts. 
    Each level becomes less abstract until we hit the final, most concrete, Surface Plane 
    where we actually place the content on the pages.</p>

              <div id="Plane1" class="subgroup">
              <h4>Strategy Plane </h4>
             

                              <p> In the Strategy Plane I defined both the Product Objectives (goals) and the User Needs 
                                (goals that come from outside).</p>
                  <h5> User Needs -</h5>
                  <p>To understand the needs of the user I conducted user survey wherein  I tried to 
                    find out<span class="highlight highlight-THD"> how digital reading is different from reading on print and how the digital 
                    revolution affected the way information is processed </span>, whether or not digital reading 
                    makes the task easier.</p>
                    <h5> User Segmentation -</h5>
                    <p>To conduct the user survey in a more organised manner I divided the users into two major segments- <br><br>

                        1. Being the readers, who read voraciously including  novels, comics. Basically the one’s who read for pleasure.<br>
                        
                        2. Includes the people who read for a specific purpose, it can be academic, or 
                        being updated.<br><br>
                        
                        Both these sectors are different in terms of their motivation and the final deliverable will kind of bridge these two and provide with a holistic environment for both.</p>

                        <h5>User Personas</h5>
                        <br> <br>

                 <h5>Major Insights from User</h5> <br> 
                 <ul><li> <span class="highlight highlight-THD"> Majority of users preferred digital medium for news and academic material. </span></li>
                   <li>   <span class="highlight highlight-THD"> For novels users preferred either print or digital reading devices.</span></li>
                    <li>They find it difficult to make a choice and also there is no one place to find the best books.</li>
                      
                      <li> Most of them preferred putting bookmarks on longer reads.</li>
                      <li><span class="highlight highlight-THD"> Felt it hard to keep track of all the readings specially when reading digitally.</span></li>
                      <li> Majority of young adults used digital mediums for all reads even when they were more comfortable in print just because of habit.</li>
                      <li><span class="highlight highlight-THD"> Half of the survey people were not very clear of the idea of e readers.</span></li>
                      <li><span class="highlight highlight-THD">  Most of users felt issue of glare and eye pain due to led displays.</span></li>

                    </ul>
				 
                  <h5>Product Objectives</h5> 
                  <p> Based on the user study the major objectives for the product included</p>
                  <ul><li> Majority of users preferred digital medium for news and academic material. </li>
                    <li>   For novels users preferred either print or digital reading devices.</li></ul>

                </div>

              <div id="Plane2" class="subgroup">
                <h4>Scope Plane </h4>
                <p>In the Scope Plane I defined what features would be included in the design, and just as importantly what features would not be included in the design. So here I considered the strategy and then created specific requirements based on the strategy. Defining the scope is a very important part of the process so the site will deliver what it is intended to deliver and also to prevent “scope creep” in which additional requirements keep creeping in while the site is being developed. 

                    For this project it was necessary to define a reasonable scope considering the short amount of time available and my beginning skills as a web developer. This plane is concerned with Functional Specifications and Content Requirements.</p>
                    <h5>Functional Requirements</h5> <br> 
                    <p>The Functional Requirements are the actual features that the tab will provide. Functional Requirements should be positive, specific and unambiguous. The functional requirements are : </p>
                    <ul><li> <span class="highlight highlight-THD"> The system will ask user to define daily, weekly or monthly page goals.</span></li>
                      <li>   The system can accept accept books via transfer from computer or downloaded directly from Amazon.</li>
                       <li>The system allows user to specify the feature list.</li>
                         <li> <span class="highlight highlight-THD"> The system uses e-ink technology which provides with bright read in all conditions.</span></li>
                         <li> The system provides with a long battery life as there is no lcd/led display.</li>
                         <li>The system can be connected to bluetooth devices, in case the user wants to listen to audiobooks.</li>
                         <li> <span class="highlight highlight-THD"> The system has accessibility features including font size, font face, line spacing and margins.</span></li>
                         <li>The system provides with a feedback when turning the page.</li>
                         
   
                       </ul>
                       <h5>Features</h5> <br> 
                       <p>The reading tab would have the following features to satisfy our goals : </p>
                       <ul><li> <span class="highlight highlight-THD"> VoiceView screen reader, available over Bluetooth audio,</span> provides spoken feedback allowing you to navigate your device and read books with text-to-speech.</li>
                         <li> <span class="highlight highlight-THD">  The user can handle with tab with one hand.</span></li>
                          <li>The tab provides with a distraction free reading.</li>
                            <li> The tab can hold up to thousands of books.</li>
                            <li> The tab provides with a long battery life. </li>
                            
                            <li> You can get library books into your tab.</li>
                            <li> Sharing is caring and with this tab you can share your books with another person.</li>
                            <li> <span class="highlight highlight-THD">  You can send documents from any of your devices to the tab using the Documents Service.</span></li>
      
                          </ul>
              </div>
              <div id="Plane3" class="subgroup">
                <h4>Structure Plane </h4>
                
                  <p>The third plane is the Structure Plane. This phase (where the factors become more concrete) defines the structure of the overall tab, i.e. how all the individual pieces fit together. This is also known as the process of defining a “conceptual structure” for the site. The two main aspects of this plane are Interaction Design and Information Architecture.</p>
                  <h5>Interaction design</h5> <br> 
                  <p>Interaction Design deals with how the user will interact with the reading tab. Here I considered conventions that are in use so that my reading tab might incorporate these conventions and thereby make using my reading tab easier for the user. So for example, I incorporated a navigation style that is quite commonly used in other reading tabs.</p>
                  <h5>Conceptual Model</h5> <br> 
                  <p>Conceptual model, is a way of representing a particular concept, or set of concepts, that helps people understand or simulate the subject of that model. Often drawn as diagrams, conceptual models show relationships between factors and the flow of data or processes.

                    I have explained the concept of this reading tab through a flow diagram.</p>
                  <img class="img-responsive full-img" src="../../assets/concept.png" alt="Kickoff Meeting"> <br> 
                  <h5>Error Handling</h5> <br>   
                  <p>Error handling is used to avoid any mistakes the users might make while using the designed interface. 
                    In the reading tab, the error handling is done by <span class="highlight highlight-THD">  providing simple and effective messages while the user will be making any important decision, so that the action is properly ensured before executing and decreasing the chances of users making any mistakes. </span>
                    Most parts of the interface are designed in a way that the actions of users can be traced back to way it was before, avoiding any regrets for the user. </p>                   
                    <h5>Information Architecture</h5> <br>   
                    <p>Information Architecture refers to organizing the information in a way that users can best understand it. In this phase, I decided that I would use a similar structure on each page so that the layout would be consistent and the user would know what to expect on each page and where to find each of the information components.

                        I struggled somewhat with the ideas presented about how to accomplish this phase. It seems like there is a <span class="highlight highlight-THD"> conflict between wanting to be innovative/unique and wanting the user to have a comfortable and familiar experience.</span> The designer must work towards finding the ideal balance between the two.
                        
                        The architecture for the system is shown below-</p>

                  <h4>Skeleton Plane </h4>    

                  <p>The Skeleton Plan deals with the actual arrangement of the various pieces of the content on the page. This would include text, images, buttons, links, etc. Here I tried to place all these elements in a way that would optimize the user experience. There are three components in this plane: Information Design, Interface Design and Navigation Design. Interface Design provides users with the ability to do things; Navigation Design provides users with the ability to go places; Information Design provides information to users. These three elements are closely related.<br> <br>

                    Information Design refers to presenting the information in the way that the user can best understand it. I decided that I would <span class="highlight highlight-THD">  present information in the hierarchy of them being used </span>and keep the page page scrollable for other options.</p>     
                    <h5>Components</h5> 
  
                     <p>Reading tablet makes use of informational components to show the minor detailing to make the user more tempted to read.</p>
                     <ul>

                    <li> Icons- Icons depict the category of book and its availability at a glance providing more info at a look.</li>
                    
                    <li>Progress Bar- This shows how what part of the book has user finished reading.</li>
                    
                    <li> Message Boxes- This is used when the user wants to delete any book and the device wants to make sure of it.</li>
                    
                    <li>Model Windows- These used to provide details about the book including its description and average time taken to read it.</li>
                    
                    <li>Notifications- Notification is used in case the battery is running low and needs to be plugged in.</li><br>                 
                  
                  
                  </ul>

                  <h5>Low Fidelity Screens</h5> 
                  <p> Concept- <ul></p>
                    <li>To design screens in a way that users are able to keep a balance of 
                         novels and academic reads on the same tablet, and also manage what 
                         they are reading effectively.</li>
                    
                    <li>The tab can be easily controlled by one hand to further provide a 
                          comfortable read.</li> </ul>

                  <br>
                  
                  <p>The “Surface” is the actual interface where our functions, features and content appear. 
                    In designing the Surface Plane a positive sensory experience is the desired goal. 
                    Although much effort has been invested in the previous four planes, it is in the Surface Plane that the user will experience the effort of all five planes. Some of the elements to be considered here are contrast and uniformity. </span></p>
                    <h5>Style Guide</h5> 
                 <p> In the digital age people are accustomed to gain knowledge or reading on their digital devices because that is most accessible to them and even handy. But these digital devices provide users with-</p>
<ul>
                  <li>Unnecessary distractions as they are linked to social and other platforms too.</li> 
                  <li> The strain that comes from their display. </li>
                </ul>
                  
                 
                <p>The main challenge here is to make accustomed <span class="highlight highlight-THD"> users use specially designed reading tablets when they are reading on stretch which makes information accessible without the problems of reading on current digital devices</span>.
                  <br>
                  
                  
                


<h4> Typeface </h4>
<p>E-ink Displays require a difference in typeface usage due to their lack of color as well as low-resolution capabilities in comparison to modern day displays. 
  The font used here is Exo. <span class="highlight highlight-THD">Exo is a contemporary geometric sans serif typeface </span> that tries to convey a technological/futuristic feeling while keeping an elegant design.

        <h4>Color Pallete</h4>
        <p>
          E-ink display provides with black and white  and shades of grey as a  display. In addition to being easier on the eyes than other display types, e-ink consumes less power, especially when compared to backlit liquid crystal display (LCD) screens. </p>

                  <p>The name of the brand is <span class="highlight highlight-THD">eMEMOTE, which means out-of-the-way </span>. 
                    The idea of this tab is provide readers with a <span class="highlight highlight-THD">platform where they are cut off from the distractions of the world </span>, including social media and be provide with a comfortable environment for every kind reading, and provide with a reading which doesn’t have any breaks I.e incessant . </p>

                  <h4>High Fidelity Screens</h4>
                
                  <p>
                  
                    The high fidelity screens are designed on the basis of the decided color pallet, keeping in mind that the interface should provide strain free read.<br><br>

                    The reading tab is made <span class="highlight highlight-THD">ergonomic in design. By placing common controls in easy to reach areas</span>, the user’s strain on the hand reduces significantly. The photo of the left shows the areas which are easy to access while using the kindle with just one hand.

                    In order to bring up this side menu, the user would need to double-tap at right-hand center.
